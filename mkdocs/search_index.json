If you have issues with recursion,\n\nZend\\Json\\Json::encode()\n and \nZend\\Json\\Encoder::encode()\n each allow an\noptional second parameter to check for recursion; if an object is serialized\ntwice, an exception will be thrown.\n\n\nDecoding JSON objects poses additional difficulty, however, since JavaScript\nobjects correspond most closely to PHP's associative array. Some suggest that a\nclass identifier should be passed, and an object instance of that class should\nbe created and populated with the key/value pairs of the JSON object; others\nfeel this could pose a substantial security risk.\n\n\nBy default, \nZend\\Json\\Json\n will decode JSON objects as \nstdClass\n objects.\nHowever, if you desire an associative array returned, you can request it using\nthe second argument to \ndecode()\n:\n\n\n// Decode JSON objects as PHP array\n$phpNative = Zend\\Json\\Json::decode($encodedValue, Zend\\Json\\Json::TYPE_ARRAY);\n\n\n\n\nAny objects thus decoded are returned as associative arrays with keys and values\ncorresponding to the key/value pairs in the JSON notation.\n\n\nThe recommendation of Zend Framework is that the individual developer should\ndecide how to decode JSON objects. If an object of a specified type should be\ncreated, it can be created in the developer code and populated with the values\ndecoded using zend-json.\n\n\nEncoding PHP objects\n\n\nIf you are encoding PHP objects, the default encoding mechanism can only\naccess public properties of these objects. When a method \ntoJson()\n is\nimplemented on an object to encode, \nZend\\Json\\Json\n calls this method and\nexpects the object to return a JSON representation of its internal state.\n\n\nZend\\Json\\Json\n can encode PHP objects recursively but does not do so by\ndefault. This can be enabled by passing \ntrue\n as the second argument to\n\nZend\\Json\\Json::encode()\n.\n\n\n// Encode PHP object recursively\n$jsonObject = Zend\\Json\\Json::encode($data, true);\n\n\n\n\nWhen doing recursive encoding of objects, as JSON does not support cycles, a\n\nZend\\Json\\Exception\\RecursionException\n will be thrown. If you wish, you can\nsilence these exceptions by passing the \nsilenceCyclicalExceptions\n option:\n\n\n$jsonObject = Zend\\Json\\Json::encode(\n    $data,\n    true,\n    ['silenceCyclicalExceptions' => true]\n);\n\n\n\n\nInternal Encoder/Decoder\n\n\nZend\\Json\n has two different modes depending if ext/json is enabled in your PHP\ninstallation or not. If \next/json\n is installed, zend-json will use the\n\njson_encode()\n and \njson_decode()\n functions for encoding and decoding JSON. If\n\next/json\n is not installed, a Zend Framework implementation in PHP code is used\nfor en/decoding. This is considerably slower than using the PHP extension, but\nbehaves exactly the same.\n\n\nSometimes you might want to use the zend-json encoder/decoder even if you have\n\next/json\n installed. You can achieve this by calling:\n\n\nZend\\Json\\Json::$useBuiltinEncoderDecoder = true;\n\n\n\n\nJSON Expressions\n\n\nJavaScript makes heavy use of anonymous function callbacks, which can be saved\nwithin JSON object variables. They only work if not returned inside double\nquotes, which zend-json implements by default. With the Expression support for\nzend-json, you can encode JSON objects with valid JavaScript callbacks.\nThis works when either \njson_encode()\n or the internal encoder is used.\n\n\nA JavaScript callback is represented using the \nZend\\Json\\Expr\n object. It\nimplements the value object pattern and is immutable. You can set the JavaScript\nexpression as the first constructor argument. By default\n\nZend\\Json\\Json::encode()\n does not encode JavaScript callbacks; you have to\npass the option \nenableJsonExprFinder\n and set it to \nTRUE\n when calling the\n\nencode()\n method. If enabled, the expression support works for all nested\nexpressions in large object structures.\n\n\nAs an example:\n\n\n$data = [\n    'onClick' => new Zend\\Json\\Expr(\n        'function() {'\n        . 'alert(\"I am a valid JavaScript callback created by Zend\\\\Json\");\n        .
